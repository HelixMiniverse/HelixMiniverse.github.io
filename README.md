# landing-page

A project by TOP to build a landing page using the knowledge of css and html, to be specific, utilizing flexbox.

I'm a big fan of Grand Blue Dreaming anime, it's one of the top anime in the comedy genre in my opinion. So, I thought it would be good to create a fanpage of some sort for the two amazing and goofiest main characters in Grand Blue, Iori Kitahara and Kohei Imamura.

All the photos used in this project, are download from google, and all the credits goes to the creator.
